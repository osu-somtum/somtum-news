Hello Everyone.

It's been a long time since we last updated osu!somtum
-# (approximately five months ago.)

Today, I’m excited to announce that **osu!somtum** is receiving a big update!
We've spent about 148 days working on **osu!somtum 5.2.2**, and it's incredible how frontend developer are now working on backend features.

We originally started developing **5.2.2** back in **October 2024**, but it was delayed due to studies and other commitments.
We only resumed progress about a week ago when school started closing, giving us more free time to work on it.

With that said, here are the new updates in **osu!somtum 5.2.2**.

### In-game Updates:
- Better Anti-Cheat
> Our old anti-cheat system simply checked if your performance points (pp) exceeded a certain limit.
> Now, we’ve implemented an advanced anti-cheat that analyzes submitted replays and restricts players if cheating is detected.

- Guild System
> Since osu! has a guild system, we decided to implement one in somtum too!
> You can join a guild using a six-character invitation code.
> When you submit a score, your guild tag will appear on the leaderboard.
> The guild leaderboard ranks guilds by combining the total score and pp of all members.

### Website Updates:
We have completely remade and revamped the frontend to better match the osu! style.
This required rebuilding everything, including API endpoints and more. (We'll get back to this later.)

- About Me
> We have added an "About Me" section to user profiles.
> The format is similar to osu!’s About Me section and supports BBCode.
> However, our BBCode implementation is currently not fully compatible with osu!'s BBCode.

- Ranking Graph
> We have implemented global rank and country rank graphs on profiles.

- Achievements on Profile
> Achievements are now displayed on user profiles.
> When you scroll down, you’ll see both locked and unlocked achievements.

- Animated Banners
> You can now upload GIFs as your profile banner, making them animated!
> -# (The file size must not exceed 3MB to maintain fast loading speeds.)

- Enhanced Web Design
> We have spent a lot of time improving the website's design.
> Our goal is to ensure that you get the same immersive experience that we do when developing somtum.

Right now, the website is experimental, so there will be bugs and glitches.
If you encounter any issues, please report them in #bug-report.

That’s all for now! While these updates may seem small, we have even bigger plans for the future.
Stay tuned for more features and an even better gameplay experience!
